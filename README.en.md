## LINK+

![LINK+](assets/preview_en.png "LINK+")

The original intention behind the design of our keyboard, LINK+, is to help us use and personalize it more effectively. With the support of the navigation bar, LINK+ enables a simpler and more responsive experience for layout modifications, custom lighting, firmware updates, and other operations.

## LINK and LINK+

LINK was launched in July 2020 and has undergone over two years of iteration. Its performance in various aspects has become stable. According to our earlier plans, we have gradually completed the development of various functions of LINK. At the same time, we have also collaborated with multiple manufacturers or organizations to promote LINK to more users.

As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. With the continuous expansion of demands and the adjustments made by the QMK Firmware community to the core firmware code, LINK has lost its ability to be compatible with the new version of QMK Firmware. Unknowingly, LINK has reached the end of its lifecycle.

LINK+ is the successor to LINK. It is a completely restructured and brand-new work based on LINK.
